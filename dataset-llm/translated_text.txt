Middelburg has been liberated without a shot being fired but while the German soldiers surrender as easy sheep the German commander Daser doesn't want to capitulate yet The general doesn't want to surrender until tomorrow, provided there's a colonel or a higher colonel in front of him. The Allies have to think of something else, because among the troops that liberated Middelburg, there's no colonel in stock. Murw The liberation of the city began days earlier when resistance forces of the Order Service sailed from Middelburg with a boat to the Allies in Vlissingen with danger of their own life. They were able to convince the English that the Germans - the headquarters are located in the center of Middelburg - are murmuring after having been under fire for days At the height - in the night of 2 to 3 November - the Allies fired a grenade every two minutes Especially the station area is heavily hit, there are 26 civilian casualties Now the sound of bombs and grenades is muttered An almost unreal silence descends on Middelburg For the first time in days Middelburger Willem de Jonge and his brother dare to go out again Around 14 30 hours together with many other residents, they see the amphibious tanks of the Allies ride into the Market in several places, groups of Scottish soldiers "But are there enough to drive away the 2000 German soldiers who are still in the city? ", the brothers ask themselves Six dead There are only two hundred Scottish soldiers in the city They left Vlissingen at noon with eleven buffaloes (amphibious vehicles) on their way to Middelburg The day before the route has been explored and the road seems safe There is no German defence on the route Yet not everyone arrives unharmed in Middelburg: one of the vehicles runs on a mine, six soldiers are killed. They're the only victims that fall on the day Middelburg is liberated. They're as tame as what, you can't be afraid of it. Although the Scots are far outnumbered, Willem de Jonge sees more and more German soldiers surrender at De Markt "With their hands up they walk towards the Scottish soldiers "They surrender as easy sheep, no shot will be fired "After those days of fighting, it is bizarre to see how peaceful the city has been taken by our liberators Everyone starts to cheer, we see resistance people from the Order Service, spontaneously we start to sing the Wilhelmus, there is a small party at De Markt," says Willem Bep Baljeu on Dam Square, near the headquarters of the Germans "They're as tame as what, you can't be afraid of it They looked relieved, were glad they got rid of it in one piece I didn't feel any anger when I looked at them " 1:36 Middelburg liberated The city can finally breathe relief The Middelburgers were afraid that their city would again suffer great damage, as did the outbreak of the war in 1940. Then the French fought against the Germans there, and surrendered only a few days after the capitulation of the Netherlands. There were few civilian casualties, but almost 600 buildings were in ruins, many Middleburgers were homeless and the historic center was severely damaged Now it is crowded in the piece of town that is still dry Beside the 7000 inhabitants there are 27 000 Zeeuwen fled to the higher center, because the Allies flooded Walcheren The houses are full of refugees, up to the attics Willem de Jonge is also home to people from elsewhere Although the surrender is not yet official, people dare to go back to the streets and hope to get home soon.
